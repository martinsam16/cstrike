; This file will store the commands used by plugins, and their access level
; To change the access of a command, edit the flags beside it and then
;   change the server's map.
;
; Example: If I wanted to change the amx_slap access to require
;          RCON access (flag "l") I would change this:
;          "amx_slap"  "e" ; admincmd.amxx
;          To this:
;          "amx_slap"  "l" ; admincmd.amxx
;
; To disable a specific command from being used with the command manager
;   and to only use the plugin-specified access set the flag to "!"
;
; NOTE: The plugin name at the end is just for reference to what plugin
;       uses what commands.  It is ignored.
